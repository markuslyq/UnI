### Introduction

With the recent Covid-19 Pandemic, most of university school life has been shifted online. This means most of us, students, are staying at home and will hardly ever be on campus physically, reducing the opportunities to meet new people, make new friends and widen one's network. This in turn makes it a lot harder to find project group mates or even course mates to discuss homework and assignments with.

However, that is only a problem if we stick to the traditional way of making friends. What if we were to digitise the means of meeting new people in NUS and allow making friends to be done remotely as well?

As such, we created a mobile platform where staff and students of NUS are able to connect with one another and expand their network, be it to discuss homework, find project groupmates or simply to make friends across the university.

### Features 

Our application would require the user to sign-up and register an account with a NUS email, which will be verified via a verification code sent to the registered email. 

#### Feature 1 - Find a match
* Users will be able to filter the matching criterias and our matching algorithm will find users that meet those criterias.  
* Filter options are as such:
  * Gender
  * Major
  * Modules
  * CCAs
  * Interest
* After successfully filtering, profiles of matched users would be displayed and there would be an option to initiate a chat with them as seen below.

#### Feature 2 - Chat
* Users are able to chat with other users who they have matched.   
* Additionally, their chat list would show a list of chats that they have, similar to that of telegram or whatsapp.

#### Feature 3 - Profile Viewing
* Users are able to view and edit their own profile where all details can be changed apart from their name and email address.
* Settings would also allow the user to logout by pressing the log out button.

### Getting Started
1. Download this repo as a zip file and unzip it into desired location.
2. Install `expo`. (Click [here](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) for the installation instructions)
3. Direct to the location of the file on your terminal and run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. Once done, run `expo start -c`.
5. Either run in on your desired emulator (IOS/Android) or scan the QR code with the phone of your choice to run it locally on the phone. 

### Thanks
As we are still in the prototyping phase, more features may be added in the future! Do let us know if you have any suggestions in the issues tab.  
We hope to someday be able to deploy the app and allow university students to have a more fulfilling experience in school!
