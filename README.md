# U&I

With the recent Covid-19 Pandemic, most of university school life has been shifted online. This means most of us, students, are staying at home and will hardly ever be on campus physically, reducing the opportunities to meet new people, make new friends and widen one's network. This in turn makes it a lot harder to find project group mates or even course mates to discuss homework and assignments with.

However, that is only a problem if we stick to the traditional way of making friends. What if we were to digitise the means of meeting new people in NUS and allow making friends to be done remotely as well?

As such, we created a mobile platform where staff and students of NUS are able to connect with one another and expand their network, be it to discuss homework, find project groupmates or simply to make friends across the university.
